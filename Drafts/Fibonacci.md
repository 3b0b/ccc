Several experimental variations on the theme of rewarding the ability to plan and execute a sequence of shots, and thereby the ability to control the cue ball.

For purposes of these ideas, treat the Fibonacci sequence as starting with (1,2), not (1,1), or specify otherwise when calling.

Note, when considering other possible scales, that it is intended that the score for a successful sequence always be better than the score for any two shorter sequences adding to the same length.


1. Resetting Scale
   1. Shooter calls a sequence of shots (ball and pocket) as long as he likes, and begins shooting.
   1. Points for each shot successfully made according to the sequence increase in a Fibonacci sequence.
   1. At any time the shooter may decide that the sequence he called is a lost cause, cancel the sequence, call a new one, and start over.
   1. When the variant is called, it should be specified how deviating from the currently called sequence, with an otherwise legal shot, without explicitly calling a new one (such as accidentally) should be scored. At the strictest, it should be no score, ball spotted, turn end. At the most permissive, it should be treated as having implicitly started a new one-shot sequence (so one point, and turn continues).

1. Completion Bonus (Repeating)
   1. Shooter calls a sequence of shots (ball and pocket) as long as he likes, and begins shooting.
   1. One point is made for each legally made ball.
   1. If the sequence is completed as called, the shooter gets a point bonus equal to the Fibonacci number with an ordinal equal to the sequence length, and then starts over from step i.
   
1. Completion Bonus (Fixed)
   1. Shooter calls a sequence of shots (ball and pocket) as long as he likes, and begins shooting.
   1. One point is made for each legally made ball.
   1. If the sequence is completed as called, the shooter gets a point bonus equal to the Fibonacci number with an ordinal equal to the sequence length. Play then passes to the next shooter.
      1. If desired, this may be called with a bonus shot, meaning that after successfully completing a sequence the shooter gets one more shot, which may incur penalties if the game incorporates them but may not earn points (or, for the sake of experimentation, may earn points but may not extend the shooter's turn any further).
