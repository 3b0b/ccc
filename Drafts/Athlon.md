1. Select the valid candidate games. Any point-accumulating game is a valid choice, including those made point-accumulating only by applying unusual modifiers, but a good list to draw from is:
   1. 6-ball (of the sort played with the remaining balls after a game of 9-ball on a coin table)
   1. 9-ball
   1. 10-ball
   1. 15-ball (sequential)
   1. Flip-flop
   1. 15-ball (ball number value)
   1. Snook
   1. Snooker (if the equipment is available)
   1. Straight pool / 14.1
1. Decide whether modifiers (such as color match exceptions or Fibonacci rules) should be applied universally or called rack by rack
1. Determine starting play order
1. Decide whether play order will remain the same, reverse with each rack, or only reverse sometimes (see below)
1. The player who will be shooting last calls the game for the first rack
1. When two balls are left on the table, the player with the lowest score for the current rack calls the next rack.
   * If there is a tie, settle it as follows:
      * The player who needs more points overall to win
      * The player with the lowest overall point total
      * The player who got fewer points on the previous rack
      * The player who was later in the starting order
   * The reason for calling the next rack with two balls left is to allow for calling 14.1 with the last ball potentially kept out of the rack. However, the calling player may choose to call explicitly a full straight pool rack, in which case the current rack is finished without leaving a ball on the table and the break on the straight pool rack is from the kitchen.
1. When the rack is completed, if it was decided that the play order should only reverse sometimes, then the player who would shoot after the current shooter decides whether to reverse the order.
